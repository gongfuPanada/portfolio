Use Ajax to load only the parts of the page that have changed.

Consider implementing Ajax as follows:
- load the new page into a javascript string
- do a diff between the current page and the new page
- replace the parts that have changed using innerHTML

Consider moving optimize_article_size() to a different location (avoid flicker).

Use Ajax to add/remove project boxes when you click on one of the nav items, to match the new tag list.  Use animation to make the project boxes fade in/out or fly on/off the page to produce the new project-box set.

Many parts of the site could be cached, such as the individual project boxes, and the tags associated with each project.  This would make the project-box code much faster.  Also, entire pages can be cached to some extent.  See <http://phplens.com/lens/php-book/optimizing-debugging-php.php>.

Do we need the onclick for tag items in html/header.php and the add_tags function in projects.js?
